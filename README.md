## Subjects learnt today:

1) Lists: a collection of values under 1 parameter
  * list.append(newValue): add more values to the end of the list
  * list.pop: to extract the **last** value from the list
  * len(list)- return the length of the list
  * list.clear()- empty the list
  * list+3: append the value 3 to the list
  * max(list),min(list),min(list),sum(list)- simple math function on the list
  * to define and init list: 
     ```
    grades:list[int]=[] - the list grades contains int values and init to empty list []
     ```
## Extra:

* keyword pass: can be used in order to make preparation without getting compilation errors.

    For example:
    ```
    while <condition>:
        pass
    else: 
        pass
    ```
* sentinel parameters: like constant numbers but usually used to represent some terminating (end) condition or have a special, symbolic meaning. 
* #DOTO: a keyword: to remainder later that some then is left to implement.
